## 🧠 **Design Philosophy / Approaches Used**

| Approach                      | Implementation                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Direct Code**            | Main `index.html`, main CSS/JS are hand-coded directly with full markup    |
| **2. Modular Components**     | Inside `/components/` folder — reusable HTML parts like modals, cards      |
| **3. Backend-Ready Frontend** | Placeholder buttons (e.g., Edit/Delete), modal forms ready for integration |
