🔧 Intfolio Enhancement Phase 1.2 components  created

✅ Folder Structure Setup
- Created professional folder structure for scalable personal portfolio project:
  └── index.html
  └── styles/
      ├── base.css (Tailwind CDN)
      ├── styles.css (custom UI, animations, responsive overrides)
      └── animations.css (custom keyframes, future-ready)
  └── scripts/
      ├── script.js (scroll effects, sidebar toggle, drawer)
      ├── modal.js (placeholder)
      ├── slider.js (carousel logic for featured projects)
      └── backend-stub.js (placeholder for future API)
  └── components/
      ├── project-card.html (modular, reusable cards)
      ├── modal-contact.html (contact modal placeholder)
      ├── modal-certificate.html (certificate modal placeholder)
      ├── slider-featured.html (dynamic featured project slider)
      └── social-icons.html (modular social links)
  └── assets/
      ├── images/ (profile and project assets)
      ├── certificates/ (PDFs to be shown via modal)
      └── icons/ (favicon etc.)
  └── docs/
      ├── README.md
      └── portfolio-report.pdf (optional internship report)
  └── vendor/ (optional external libraries)
  └── .gitignore

🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
- `styles.css`: added responsive layout, flex/grid system, project card design
- Created reusable design tokens via CSS variables: `--header-h`, `--sidebar-w-c`, `--accent`, etc.
- Advanced sticky header with scroll shrink effect
- Sidebar with collapse/expand feature and icon-rail
- Fully responsive footer with 3 sections: branding, links, social

🚀 Component Injection
- Added `data-include` pattern for modular HTML component inclusion
- Allowed reusability of `project-card.html` in any section using JS loader
- Ensured graceful fallback if data is not yet available

🖼️ Featured Slider (Multi-Item Carousel)
- Built advanced `slider-featured.html`:
  • Auto-loop enabled
  • Manual controls: next/prev
  • Future-ready to support multiple slide pages
- Created `slider.js`:
  • Handles sliding logic
  • Future support for dynamic card pages (grouped 3-per-slide)
  • Continuous autoplay with interval loop

📜 Script Enhancements
- `script.js`:
  • Sidebar expand/collapse
  • Scroll-triggered header morph
  • Mobile hamburger menu drawer
- `slider.js`:
  • Multiple slide display and carousel interaction
  • Animations and accessibility controls added

🧪 Testing Setup
- Ensured all components (cards, slider, nav) are modular and independently testable
- Verified responsiveness and animation behavior across breakpoints

🗂️ Notes
- No backend or dynamic JSON data used yet — placeholder components used instead
- PHP removed, all `<?php include ?>` replaced with JS-based modular loading
- Future plans: modal interactions, dynamic data from backend

📅 Timeline: Phase 1 Complete
