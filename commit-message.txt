ðŸ§© Added modular UI templates: header, footer, and expandable sidebars

âœ” Created reusable header and footer partials for dynamic page loading
   â€¢ To be injected into index via JS fetch()
   â€¢ Clean layout and consistent styling for branding sections

âœ” Developed expandable left sidebar (navigation menu)
   â€¢ Includes accessible toggle button with animation
   â€¢ Contains structured nav links: Home, Upload, Dashboard, Verify, Contact
   â€¢ Responsive design using `transform: translateX(-100%)` with smooth slide-in effect

âœ” Developed expandable right sidebar (user/account options)
   â€¢ Toggle support with matching smooth slide-in animation from right
   â€¢ Contains user-specific nav: Profile, Settings, Theme Toggle, Logout

âœ” Sidebar toggle logic wired via shared JS `toggleSidebar(id)` function
âœ” Sidebar styles are scoped using BEM-style IDs and flexible classes
âœ” Visual consistency ensured using modern hover transitions and icon-enhanced links
âœ” Component classes support light mode by default and align with dark mode fallback in global CSS

ðŸ›  These templates are plug-and-play ready and support modular layout architecture
ðŸ§± Foundation for scalable, multi-page UI navigation and future login/theme logic
