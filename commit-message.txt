"🧠 Implemented dynamic certificate verification logic with modular JS

✔ Built two separate verification flows:
   • Manual simulation via verifyStudent()
   • API-ready async verification via verifyWithAPI() + fetchStudentData()

✔ Simulated dummy user data with proper structure (name, email, assignments, certificate link)
✔ Rendered student profile using dynamic HTML templates and animations
   • Includes card layout with name, email, domain, image, and status badges
   • Assignment statuses displayed using intuitive ✅ / ❌ indicators

✔ Added real-time user feedback mechanisms:
   • showToast(): interactive toast notification with auto-dismiss
   • showSpinner(): central loader toggle function tied to user actions
   • Toasts styled for visibility, positioned with smooth fade-in/out behavior

✔ Included accessibility and UX enhancements:
   • Enter key triggers verification automatically
   • Verified empty input cases and handles gracefully
   • Minimal blocking UI; loading states managed efficiently

✔ Sidebar toggle support:
   • toggleSidebar(id): universal sidebar expansion/collapse logic
   • Compatible with expandable left/right sidebar layout

✔ Code structured for future extension:
   • Easily switch from mock to API by calling verifyWithAPI()
   • Encapsulated functions, no global state leakage
   • Comments provided for clarity and maintainability

🔒 Ensured no personal data, hardcoded paths, or user-specific references are included
📦 JS is now production-ready, scalable, and aligned with modern web standards
