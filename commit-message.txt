feat: Set up internship carousel page with modular folder structure

- Created InternshipPage/ project folder with 3-part separation:
  - internship.html: Base structure for internship listings
  - style.css: Styles for layout, cards, and responsive design
  - script.js: Carousel logic placeholder (to be implemented)
- Added semantic HTML5 structure with header, section, and footer areas
- Included 4 detailed internship cards (Web, AI/ML, UI/UX, DevOps)
- Applied mobile-friendly viewport settings and clean class naming
- Used "Apply Now" and "Details" buttons in each card for interaction
